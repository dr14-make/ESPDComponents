# VehicleBody Test: Coast-Down
# ============================================================================
#
# Objective: Verify combined drag and rolling resistance
# Expected: Vehicle decelerates to stop
#
# Reference: Documentation/VehicleBody.md
#
# TODO: Instantiate your VehicleBody component
# Example:
# vehicle = VehicleBody(
# m = 1000.0,
# Cd = 0.32,
# A = 2.2,
# rho = 1.225,
# Crr = 0.015,
# g = 9.81
# )
#
# TODO: Add ground reference
# Example:
# ground = TranslationalComponents.Fixed()
#
# TODO: Connect components
# Example:
# connect(vehicle.flange, ground.flange)
#
# TODO: Set initial conditions (coasting from speed)
# Example:
# initial vehicle.v = 30.0  # Start at 30 m/s
# initial vehicle.flange.s = 0.0
#
# TODO: Add analysis
# Example:
# analysis TestVehicleBody_CoastDown_Analysis
# extends TransientAnalysis(stop = 100.0, alg = "Rodas5P")
# model = TestVehicleBody_CoastDown()
# end
#
# VALIDATION (calculate BEFORE running):
# - Initial deceleration at v=30 m/s
# - Drag dominates at high speed (quadratic with v)
# - Rolling resistance dominates at low speed (constant)
# - Calculate expected time and distance to stop
# - Energy balance: initial kinetic energy = work done by drag + work done by rolling resistance
#
# VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
# [ ] Vehicle decelerates continuously
# [ ] Velocity reaches zero
# [ ] Energy dissipated matches initial kinetic energy (< 1% error)
# [ ] Deceleration profile matches physics
