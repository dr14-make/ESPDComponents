WheelContact Connector
============================================================================

This connector represents the mechanical interface between a wheel and
vehicle body, combining both traction (tangential) and normal (vertical)
forces along with their corresponding positions.

Physical Interpretation:
- s_traction: Longitudinal position of the contact point [m]
- f_traction: Traction force (tangential to road, propels vehicle) [N]
- s_normal: Vertical position of the contact point [m] (typically fixed)
- f_normal: Normal force (perpendicular to road, load on wheel) [N]

Sign Conventions:
- f_traction > 0: Force pushing vehicle forward (from wheel perspective)
- f_normal > 0: Force pushing wheel down (weight on wheel)

Usage Example:
In Wheel component:
contact = WheelContact()  # Connect to vehicle body
# Wheel receives: N = -contact.f_normal (normal force from body)
# Wheel provides: F_traction via contact.f_traction

In VehicleBody component:
contact_rear = WheelContact()  # Connect to rear wheels
# Body provides: N via contact_rear.f_normal
# Body receives: F_traction from wheels via contact_rear.f_traction

Connection Pattern:
connect(wheel_left.contact, vehicle.contact_rear)
connect(wheel_right.contact, vehicle.contact_rear)

This single connection handles BOTH traction and normal forces automatically!
