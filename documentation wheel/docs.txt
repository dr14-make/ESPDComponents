Objective Wheel: advance the IdealRollingWheel component by means of adding slipping, etc.

https://help.juliahub.com/dyad/dev/stdlib/RotationalComponents/components/IdealRollingWheel.html

Now the IdealRollingWheel has only pure rolling:

  (spline.phi - support_r.phi) * radius = flange.s - support_t.s
  0 = radius * flange.f + spline.tau

It has a perfect kinematic constraint between angular motion and translational motion and a static force balance.
